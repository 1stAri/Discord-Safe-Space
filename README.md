## Introduction

I participated in the creation and moderation of a discord server where I was granted permissions that fit my role as secondary administrator. By assisting the server owner, I was able to review audit logs, check for potentially suspicious activity of violations to the server policy (the rules set by the owner), and conduct meetings with the server owner to ensure the serverâ€™s security measures and operations were up to date and consistent.

## Environment Setup
During the developement phase of the server, I assisted the server owner with ensuring that the different discord bots, channels, roles, and permissions worked as intended. I was given the role of secondary administrator, meaning I was not allowed to full control over the server. I upkept separation of duties by sticking to the role I was given, and escalated any issues beyond my role to the server owner. Two discord bots that helped streamline the moderation process were:

<br /> <br />

Carl-bot was responsible for collecting activity logs and aggregating them into a single channel for overview. The logs included a date, time, action performed, and any changes that were made if applicable. Tickets was the system the moderation team used to address user concerns. When a user had a problem n the server, such as a false warning being triggered on their profile, they could submit a ticket to have the moderation team review and determine if the event was a false positive or otherwise.
<br /> <br />

## Testing and Editing

To prevent server raids, we implemented two-factor authentication and Discord's AutoMod bot which provided built in security features that lock down a server to stop further intrusion. Other bots were configured to detect spamming from users and automatically issue a warning. Before the server was officially launched for other users to enter, the moderation team invited a trusted tester into the server to make sure that everything in the server was running properly. We ran into a few issues with some of the bots not working properly, and the tester brought to our attention a few user concerns such as not being able to access certain channels. Thanks to the testing phase, we were able to address those issues before the server launched.
<br /> <br />
Some of the moderation bots offered features that were used to make sure that the server was neat and in order, but Mimu was the primary bot that the moderation team used to accomplish this. It was important that the server policy (or server rules) and welcome area was both visually appealing and functional. The users in the server were much like stakeholders in the sense that they did not always understand the technical side or reasoning behind things. Mimu helped mitigate this problem and simply communication by offering the clear visuals for users and functionality on the tecnical side of things for the moderators.

## Conclusion

Once the server was completely reviewed, it was launched to the users. I continue to stay within my role as a secondary server adminisrator, and ensure that the server remains a safe space for all users.
<br /> <br />
After completing this project, I have a better understanding of audit logs and separation of duties. I was also able to take feedback from an external user to make improvements to the server alongside the moderation team. I intend to take these lessons and use them in my career to ensure that I can effectively collaborate with my team members, stay within my assigned role, and clearly communicate to stakeholders in the future.
